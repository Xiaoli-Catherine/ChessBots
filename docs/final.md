## Project Summary
Our project aims to explore and analyze the specific performance task of a robot arm setting a chessboard within the RLBench environment. Our approach involves experimenting with existing algorithms in the RLBench environment, tweaking them to improve their performance, and conducting a comparative study to understand the impact of these modifications. For this project, the input will include task specifications and environmental observations, such as RGB, depth, and segmentation masks, while the output will involve the successful completion of the checkerboard setup task.
