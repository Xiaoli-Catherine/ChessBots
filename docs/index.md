#### Project Outline:

Our project aims to explore and analyze the specific performance task of a robot arm setting a chessboard with the RLBench environment. Our approach involves experimenting with existing algorithms in the RLBench environment, tweaking them to improve their performance, and conducting a comparative study to understand the impact of these modifications.
