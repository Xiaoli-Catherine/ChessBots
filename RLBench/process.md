1. init_task
Adjust the success conditions by adding or removing DetectedCondition or NothingGrasped conditions. Introduce new conditions, such as time limits or penalties for dropping pieces.

Modify the list of graspable objects (self.checkers or self.pieces) to include or exclude specific pieces.

Adjust the positions or sensitivity of the proximity sensors (self.success_detectors) to make the task easier or harder.

2. init_episode
Modify the number of pieces to be set up (self.checkers_to_setup or self.nsetup) to create different levels of difficulty. Randomize the starting positions of the pieces more aggressively to increase the diversity of training scenarios.

Modify the natural language instructions returned in the rtn or cmds lists to provide more detailed or varied instructions for the task.

Change how target pieces are selected.Instead of randomly selecting pieces, you could prioritize pieces based on their distance from the starting position or their type (e.g., kings vs. pawns in chess).

3. _move_above_next_target
Adjust the waypoint positions (w1 and w4) to change the robot's motion trajectory. Modify the z-offset for picking and placing pieces to account for different gripper designs or piece sizes.

Implement more sophisticated motion planning algorithms (e.g., RRT or A*) to generate waypoints dynamically based on the current state of the environment.

Possibly add error handling for edge cases, such as when a piece is dropped or misplaced.

4. Success Conditions and Rewards
Modify the reward function to provide more granular feedback. For example, you could reward the robot for getting closer to the target position, even if it doesnâ€™t fully succeed in placing the piece.

Add penalties for collisions, dropping pieces, or taking too long to complete the task.

Introduce partial success conditions.
